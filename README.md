## Why do we need this study? 
Deep Learning has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of medical imaging and has shown great potential in aiding the health community in the detection and diagnosis of brain tumors. By leveraging deep learning algorithms, we can analyze medical images, such as MRI or CT scans, with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Also, it can assist in the classification of brain tumors into different subtypes. By training models on large datasets of labeled brain tumor images, deep learning algorithms can learn to distinguish between various tumor types, such as gliomas, meningiomas, or metastatic tumors. This classification capability can aid in determining the appropriate treatment approach and prognosis for patients. Overall, deep learning has the potential to revolutionize brain tumor detection and diagnosis. By leveraging the power of neural networks, we can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and understanding of brain tumor imaging, ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes in the field of neuro-oncology.

## Problem Statement
The accurate detection and classification of Brain Tumors play a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients. However, manual interpretation of Medical Images, such as MRI scans, can be time-consuming and subjective, leading to potential errors and delays in patient care. Therefore, there is a need for an automated and reliable method to detect and classify brain tumors from medical images.

## Study Aim
This study aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the PyTorch framework that can accurately detect and classify Brain Tumors from MRI scans. The CNN will be trained on a large dataset of labeled brain tumor images to learn the patterns and features associated with different tumor types. The study aims to achieve high accuracy in tumor detection and classification, providing a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in the field of neuro-oncology. The ultimate goal is to improve the efficiency and accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis, enabling timely and appropriate treatment planning for patients.
