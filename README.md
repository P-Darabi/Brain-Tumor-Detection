## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of brain MRI images. The images are labeled as benign or malignant, which are used to train the deep learning model for classification.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. This architecture is designed to automatically extract features from MRI images and classify them into benign or malignant categories.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/P-Darabi/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git
    cd Brain-Tumor-Detection
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 25
```

### Evaluating the Model

To evaluate the model, run the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/trained_model.pth --test_data /path/to/test_data
```

### Jupyter Notebook

You can also explore and experiment with the model in the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook brain-tumor-detection-by-cnn-pytorch.ipynb
```
